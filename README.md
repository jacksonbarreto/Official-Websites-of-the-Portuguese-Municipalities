# Portuguese City Council Websites

This repository contains a list of 308 Portuguese city council websites, along with their corresponding district, municipality, and website address. The data was collected from the website of the Direção-Geral das Autarquias Locais (DGAL), a central service of the direct state administration integrated into the Ministry of Territorial Cohesion from Portugal, on December 14, 2022, and includes the most recent update from November 3, 2021 [1]. We also performed a manual review of all websites, where we identified and corrected some incorrect web addresses via a Google search for the corresponding city council.

This list was used in a study on the cybersecurity of Portuguese city council websites. In the interest of promoting open science [2], the list is being made publicly available.
